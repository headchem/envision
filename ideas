infinite arena playing area

good boxes (white border)
bad boxes (black border)
hurt boxes (bullets)
speed boxes (either increases bullet speed while decreasing player speed, or vice versa)
color boxes (adds a particular amount of red, green, or blue to the player)

all boxes have an RGB color

red hurts blue
blue hurts green
green hurts red

bullets that hit a target very close to each other in time, do extra damage (so AI should try to maximize this)

player/bullets stronger in color do more damage, while making the player weaker to the opposing color of damage, so AI should strike a balance, or go to an extreme?
